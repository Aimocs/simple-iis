# Institute Information System (IIS)

IIS is a project designed to manage institutional data, including students, teachers, courses, and staff. The system allows staff members to efficiently add and manage student details, assign teachers to courses, and create student-teacher groups.

> **Note:** This project is developed as part of my **fourth-semester Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** curriculum.
